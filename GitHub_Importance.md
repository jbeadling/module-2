### Importance of Git and Github 

---

Git runs locally on your machine, you don't need to register for an account and you don't need the internet. Using Git costs nothing. 

There are many extensions of Git such as Bitbucket, GitLab, etc that allow you to host
your repos online at little or no cost and will enhance Git's features with their own 
tools. We will be focusing on Github.

Github is a hosting platform for Git repositories. You can put your own repos on Github
and access it anywhere in the world as well as share them with anyone in the world. Beyond
hosting repos, Github also provide collaboration features that are not native to git. The
essential point is that Github helps people share and collaborate on repos. 

Github is the most popular platform for people to host their Git repositories, many of the biggest open source projects are on there and though there is a paid service many of the features are available for free and you can do much with spending any money. Github also has many tools available only on their platform such as Github actions that give you CI/CD workflows.

Because Github allows anyone to host their code it has made collaboration easier and cheaper. Many open source projects gain their footing on Github and Github is the main 
platform where most open source communities communicate. 

It allows easier learning and teaching, may courses and curriculums are hosted on Github, teachers and students often collaborate and share work on there. 

Because Github has no cost to host, share, and collaborate anyone can setup a repo with
interesting concepts or ideas and share them with everyone. Best of all if those repos are 
public anyone can fork these repos and modify the code themselves. They can make pull 
requests and improve the code or add a feature.

As of right now I can5 setup a brand new repo with all the code and documentation and someone can fork it or make a pull request. They can comment or send me a direct message,
all within a few minutes. Github makes communication and collaboration fast, easy, and cheap.
